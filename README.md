# 8 Puzzle Code
This project implements three search algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem: Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A* Search with the Misplaced Tile heuristic, and A* Search with the Manhattan Distance heuristic. The goal is to analyze and compare their efficiency in terms of execution time, number of expanded nodes, and memory usage. The implementation allows testing different initial states and visualizing the performance differences among the algorithms.

By leveraging heuristic-based approaches, the project demonstrates how informed search strategies like A with Manhattan Distance* significantly outperform uninformed methods like UCS. The repository includes the complete implementation, test cases, and performance analysis to provide insights into heuristic search efficiency.

The project report is attached in this repository.
