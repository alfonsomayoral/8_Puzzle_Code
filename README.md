# 8_Puzzle_Code
This project implements three search algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem: Uniform Cost Search (UCS), A Search with the Misplaced Tile heuristic*, and A Search with the Manhattan Distance heuristic*. The goal is to analyze and compare their efficiency in terms of execution time, number of expanded nodes, and memory usage.
